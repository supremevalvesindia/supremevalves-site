    <h1>Technical FAQs — Valves & Strainers</h1>

    <section class="faq-list">
      <details>
        <summary>How do I select valve materials for sea‑water service?</summary>
        <p>Use corrosion‑resistant alloys such as SS316/SS904L or Cu‑Ni for wetted parts. Avoid plain carbon steel internals. Consider cathodic protection and crevice‑resistant designs. Refer to our Materials page for a media vs. material matrix.</p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>What is the difference between ASME Class and PN ratings?</summary>
        <p>ASME Classes (e.g., 150/300/600) are pressure–temperature systems defined in ASME B16.34 tables. PN ratings (e.g., PN16/PN25/PN40) are nominal pressure ratings in bar under EN standards. They are not directly interchangeable; consult the PT tables.</p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>Which standards apply to face‑to‑face dimensions?</summary>
        <p>Commonly ASME B16.10 for valves and manufacturer standards for strainers. Always verify per valve type and standard specified in the datasheet.</p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>What testing is performed on valves?</summary>
        <p>Hydrostatic shell and seat tests per API 598 (or ISO 5208/EN 12266). Special tests such as FE (fugitive emissions), cryogenic, and fire‑safe can be provided on request.</p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>How do I size an electric or pneumatic actuator?</summary>
        <p>Base sizing on maximum differential pressure, media factor, and valve torque/thrust with safety margin. Include fail‑safe position, travel time, and control signal requirements.</p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>What mesh size should I use for a Y or basket strainer?</summary>
        <p>Typically select 2–3 times smaller than the minimum particle size to protect downstream equipment. Balance pressure drop against filtration fineness. Provide DP ports and set a cleaning threshold (e.g., 0.5 bar).</p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>Can I install a valve in vertical pipelines?</summary>
        <p>Yes, but check the valve type. Check valves and strainers have preferred flow directions; orientation affects performance and maintenance access.</p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>What documents are supplied with valves?</summary>
        <p>Standard: hydro test reports, MTCs (EN 10204 3.1), GA drawings. On request: IBR, NACE/MRO175 compliance, fire‑safe, PMI, FE tests, and ATEX/IECEx for actuators.</p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>How do I mitigate water hammer?</summary>
        <p>Use non‑slam/nozzle check valves, slow‑closing actuators, surge tanks, and proper line sizing. Verify transient analysis for critical services.</p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>What is the difference between floating and trunnion ball valves?</summary>
        <p>Floating: ball is supported by seats and moves to seal; suited for small/medium sizes, moderate pressures. Trunnion: ball is supported by trunnions; lower operating torque, better for large sizes and higher pressures.</p>
